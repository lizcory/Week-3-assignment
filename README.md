# Week-3-assignment

1. Use the Netflix data to create a bar chart in the SVG with release year (releaseYear) and the number of releases (num rows for each year)

2. Create a geographic map and make bubbles or choropleth (or something more creative you can think of) -- linking between "country" in netflix dataset and "name" in geojson

3. Use brush to filter out years on the bar chart that will change the maps as well

4. Populate the dropdown to be able to select the genre for both charts

5. Setup git to ignore .DS_Store file
